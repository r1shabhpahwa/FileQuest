# FileQuest

This is a client-server project developed for COMP-8567 course at an University of Windsor during Winter 2023 semester. In this project, a client can request a file or a set of files from the server. The server searches for the file/s in its file directory rooted at its ~ and returns the tar.gz of the file/files requested to the client (or an appropriate message otherwise). Multiple clients can connect to the server from different machines and can request file/s.
